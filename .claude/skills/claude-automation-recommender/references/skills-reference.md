# Skills Recommendations

Skills are packaged expertise with workflows, reference materials, and best practices. Create them in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Skills can be invoked by Claude automatically when relevant, or by users directly with `/skill-name`.

Some pre-built skills are available through official plugins (install via `/plugin install`).

**Note**: These are common patterns. Use web search to find skill ideas specific to the codebase's tools and frameworks.

## Available from Official Plugins

### Git Workflows (commit-commands)

| Skill | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **commit** | Creating git commits with proper messages |
| **commit-push-pr** | Full commit, push, and PR workflow |

### Frontend (frontend-design)

| Skill | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| **frontend-design** | Creating polished UI components |

**Value**: Creates distinctive, high-quality UI instead of generic AI aesthetics.

## Custom Project Skills

Create project-specific skills in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

### Skill Structure

```
.claude/skills/
└── my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md           # Main instructions (required)
    ├── template.yaml      # Template to apply
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── validate.sh    # Script to run
    └── examples/          # Reference examples
```

### Frontmatter Reference

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill does and when to use it
disable-model-invocation: true  # Only user can invoke (for side effects)
user-invocable: false           # Only Claude can invoke (for background knowledge)
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob # Restrict tool access
context: fork                   # Run in isolated subagent
agent: Explore                  # Which agent type when forked
---
```

### Invocation Control

| Setting | User | Claude | Use for |
|---------|------|--------|---------|
| (default) | ✓ | ✓ | General-purpose skills |
| `disable-model-invocation: true` | ✓ | ✗ | Side effects (deploy, send) |
| `user-invocable: false` | ✗ | ✓ | Background knowledge |

## Custom Skill Examples

### Database Migration Generator

```yaml
---
name: create-migration
description: Create a database migration file
disable-model-invocation: true
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash
---

Create a migration for: $ARGUMENTS

1. Generate migration file in `migrations/` with timestamp prefix
2. Include up and down functions
3. Validate syntax
4. Report any issues found
```

### PR Review with Checklist

```yaml
---
name: pr-check
description: Review PR against project checklist
disable-model-invocation: true
context: fork
---

## PR Context
- Diff: !`gh pr diff`
- Description: !`gh pr view`

Review against checklist.md.
```

---

## Argument Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` | All args as string | `/deploy staging` → "staging" |

## Dynamic Context Injection

Use `!`command`` to inject live data before the skill runs:

```yaml
## Current State
- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Status: !`git status --short`
```
